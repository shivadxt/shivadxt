### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on solidity and node.js
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tensorflow v2.0 and pyTorch
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on backend projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about : Blockchains - Staking - DeFi protocols - Crypto - Smart Contracts

As a skilled blockchain developer with expertise in Solidity, ERC721, ERC20, and ERC1155 tokens, I have a passion for creating innovative solutions that leverage the power of blockchain technology. With a deep understanding of the underlying principles of blockchain, I have worked on a wide range of projects across different blockchain infrastructures, including Ethereum, chainlink and other popular networks.

1) Solidity: I've expertise in developing smart contracts using Solidity.
2) Token Standards: Experience in creating ERC721, ERC20, and ERC1155 tokens, which are popular token standards used for creating digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
3) NFT: Maintained NFT projects and have experience in creating, deploying, and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
4) Blockchain Infrastructure: Knowledge and experience in working with different blockchain infrastructures, including Ethereum, Graph, and other popular blockchain networks.
5) Decentralized Applications: Working experience in developing decentralized applications (DApps) that run on blockchain networks, including creating front-end interfaces that interact with smart contracts.
6) Security: Understanding of security best practices in the blockchain space and know how to write secure smart contracts to prevent potential security risks.
7) Cryptography: Knowledge of cryptographic algorithms and their applications in blockchain technology, such as digital signatures, hash functions, and encryption.

My Views on Web3.0/Blockchain : It's been 2 years in blockchain from me and I strongly believe in the projects who are actually solving some real pain points of customers or any user segment, Rather than just creating a product then hyping it up and end being dead. Core value proposition is somewhere missing from these projects at the end only the fundamentally strong projects will make it.
